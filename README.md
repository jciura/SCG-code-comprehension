# A system supporting code comprehension based on large language models and a semantic code graph

Created system is a tool that can be used by professional programmers to better understand large and developing
projects, or starting programmers to easier learn coding based on given project.
To get wider context it uses SCG graph, and more specifically [scg-cli tool](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scg-cli) to
generate it.

System is an MCP Server that can be used with tool chosen by the user. It supports code written in Scala and Java

## Methods of MCP Server

MCP Server has 4 main methods. Each of them can be called one of four paths to retrieve context of code entities.

1. ask_specific_nodes - used to retrieve context of specific node/nodes included in question
2. ask_top_nodes - used to retrieve context to question related to ranking nodes
3. ask_general_question - used to retrieve context to question without mentioned specific node/nodes
4. list_related_entities - used to get all related entities to entity specified in question

To better understand how these method works read file [AGENT.md](src/clients/AGENT.md)

## Basic flow of the system

## How to run

1. Generate .semanticgraph files, SCG graph file, file containing metrics of SCG and embeddings for project using
   `app\main_runner.py` with argument: `--project path_to_project` - It may take a while for big projects
   If project is written in Scala .semanticgraph files need to be generated by user. More on this
   in [here](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scg-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#generating-project-scg-metadata)
2. Connect MCP Server to Agent that is supposed to choose MCP function, it's parameters and formulate question.

   General form to add MCP Server is listed below:
    ```json
   {
   "mcpServers": {
    "scg-context": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["{PROJECT_PATH}/src/clients/mcpserver.py"],
    }
   }
   }
   ``` 
   If chosen tool support it insert whole file `AGENT.md` for Agent to analyze

3. Start asking question related to project
